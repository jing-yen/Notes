# Quick Notes
I always loved making notes and lists, however I find the design of many notetaking apps to be lacking (looking at you, Evernote). Over the holidays, I tried to code my own simple notes app, presented here in all its open-source glory. Granted, it is still very much a work in progress, but I am in love with the design.

I have also developed another notes app as a web app with cloud sync and multiplatform support, but since it hosts my personal notes I will not be sharing it anytime soon :)
